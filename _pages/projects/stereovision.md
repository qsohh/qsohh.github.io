This project implements a pipeline for obstacle and lane marking detection from stereo camera input, using traditional computer vision techniques such as disparity estimation, edge detection, and Hough transforms.

---

## Project Goals

Detect lane markings and obstacles using stereo vision, disparity maps, and geometric reasoning â€” **without deep learning**.

## Input stereo images

## Main Processing steps

- Applied morphological filtering and edge detection to extract structural features.
  - Lane markings were further isolated by subtracting a low-pass filtered version of the image (using a rectangular median local threshold filter), which enhanced **horizontal high-frequency components**. This helped distinguish lane markings from vehicles or other low-frequency features.
- Constructed a vertical disparity map (`v-disparity`) to identify the road plane and detect vertical features above it.
- Applied Hough transform in v-disparity space to extract dominant straight lines.
  - Two key lines in this space represent the set of lane boundaries and the elevated structure (i.e., the vehicle in our scene).
- Compared multiple filtering strategies (mean, median, morphological opening, and Canny edge detection) to assess their relative performance in lane and obstacle extraction.

## Road Profile Estimation

We used the vertical disparity map (v-disparity) to model the road surface.  
The bottom part of the v-disparity image shows a linear pattern corresponding to the ground plane.  
A Hough transform was applied in the v-disparity space to detect this line.

Points significantly above this line were flagged as potential vertical obstacles.  
The horizontal position (`u`) and vertical (`v`) disparity together reconstruct the 3D geometry of the scene.

## Evaluation and Thresholding Analysis

To evaluate the performance of lane marking detection, we varied the binarization threshold. We plotted the detection rate and false alarm rate as the threshold varies.

> A tighter threshold detects more pixels of lane markings but increases false positives; a looser threshold reduces false alarms but may miss target pixels.

> Pixel color: red -> blue corresponds to near -> far depth.

## Final results

<img src="/assets/images/projects_MIV308/result.jpg" width="45%">

> Scene segmentation: red = lane markings, yellow = road, blue = occupied area, green = detected obstacle.

---

## Tools Used

- **Matlab**: implemented the entire detection pipeline using image processing toolbox and custom stereo geometry code.
