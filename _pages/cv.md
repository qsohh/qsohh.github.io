Work experience
======

**Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics**, EDF R&D & Université de Bourgogne  
*2021 – 2024*  
- Developed and analyzed numerical schemes for non-regular dynamics, with applications to dynamic contact problems under strong constraints.  
- Implemented simulation tools in Python/C++ and collaborated with EDF R&D for validation and industrial modeling.  
- Focused on stable implicit integration methods (HHT-α, TR-BDF2, time-discontinuous Galerkin), Nitsche’s method, penalty, and augmented Lagrangian approaches.

**Consultant**, SNCF ITG Group, Paris, France  
*Mar. 2020 – Jan. 2021*  
- Track geometry calculations using data from commercial trains.  
- Applied non-uniform Fourier transform and wavelet transform to detect rail deformations and support predictive maintenance.

**End-of-Studies Internship**, Ikos Consulting  
*Apr. 2019 – Oct. 2019*  
- Modeled CBTC (Communication-Based Train Control) systems using Petri Nets.  
- Developed a train control simulator in Python.  
- Studied formal verification methods and EN 50126/50128 railway safety standards.  
- Selected as one of the school's best final-year internships.

**Head of Chassis Division**, Shell Eco-Marathon (ENSTA Paris team)  
*Sep. 2018 – Apr. 2019*  
- Led a multinational team (3 nationalities) to design and optimize a lightweight, robust chassis system for a competition vehicle.

**Research Intern**, SNCF R&D  
*May 2018 – Aug. 2018*  
- Developed probabilistic simulations for railway gauge analysis using Wilks' quantile, Monte Carlo methods, and importance sampling.
